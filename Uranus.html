            <h2 style="color:burlywood">Uranus was the first planet to be discovered using a telescope. It is also the only planet to be named after a Greek deity, Ouranos the sky god, rather than a Roman one. The seventh planet from the sun is an ice giant. It is composed of heavier elements than its gas giant neighbors, being a mixture of water, methane and ammonia ice. Also unlike other planets in the solar system, Uranus effectively orbits on its side (with its axis almost pointing toward the sun), and it "rolls" like a ball as it travels around the sun. Methane gas in Uranus' atmosphere makes the planet appear green-blue. Uranus also has 13 rings and 27 moons.</h2>
