        <h3 style="color:white">Neptune is the eighth and farthest-known Solar planet from the Sun. In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth, slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere. The planet orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1 AU (4.5 billion km; 2.8 billion mi). It is named after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol â™†, representing Neptune's trident.Predicted Neptune existed before they observed it for the first time because of its effect on Uranus' orbit. NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft is the only mission to have visited the ice giant. Neptune, named after the Roman sea god, is so far away from the sun that it takes 4 hours for sunlight to reach the planet. (It takes about eight minutes for sunlight to reach Earth.) When the light arrives at Neptune, it is 900 times dimmer than what we see on Earth, according to NASA. About 80% of the Neptune's mass is made up of water, methane and ammonia surrounding a small, rocky core. Strong winds on the planet propel clouds of frozen methane at speeds of up to 1,200 mph (2,000 km/h). Neptune has 14 known moons, one of which was rediscovered</h3>
