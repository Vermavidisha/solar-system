        <h2 style="color:thistle">Earth is the only planet known to support life. It offers liquid water, an oxygen-rich atmosphere, and protection from the Sunâ€™s harmful radiation.
        By exploring the cosmos, we learn more about Earth and how life evolved here.
        Asteroids occasionally impact Earth and cause widespread damage. With proper planning, we can prevent this natural disaster from happening.
        Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago along with Venus and Mars. Space missions have shown us that Mars was once warm, wet, and had conditions favorable to life. Venus likewise may have once had global oceans.Earth's atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen. More solar energy is received by tropical regions than polar regions and is redistributed by atmospheric and ocean circulation. Greenhouse gases also play an important role in regulating the surface temperature. A region's climate is not only determined by latitude, but also by elevation and proximity to moderating oceans, among other factors. Severe weather, such as tropical cyclones, thunderstorms, and heatwaves, occurs in most areas and greatly impacts life</h2>
