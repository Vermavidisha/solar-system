<P style="color:white">The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it. Of the bodies that orbit the Sun directly, the largest are the four gas and ice giants and the four terrestrial planets, followed by an unknown number of dwarf
    planets and innumerable small Solar System bodies. Of the bodies that orbit the Sun indirectly—the natural satellites—two are larger than Mercury and one is nearly as large.</P>

<h2 style="color:antiquewhite">How old is our solar system?</h2>

<h3 style="color:blanchedalmond">Meteorites, or pieces of space rock that have fallen to Earth, have helped scientists figure out the age of the solar system. Some of these small pieces of space rock, or meteoroids, have broken off moons or planets, and can yield interesting scientific
information about the chemistry and history of their home body; others have been traveling around our solar system since that primordial dust-cloud collapse, before those planets even existed. The Allende meteorite, which fell to Earth in 1969 and scattered over Maxico,is the oldest known meteoroites,dated to4.55 billion years old.</h3>
