        <h2 style="color:thistle"> Jupiter is the biggest planet in the solar system. Unlike its four neighbors closer to the sun, Jupiter is a gas giant, mainly made up of helium and hydrogen. It is named after the king of the Roman gods, who is also known as Zeus in the Greek pantheon.
        Jupiter is twice as big as all of the other planets in the solar system combined, and yet it also has the shortest day of any planet, taking 10 hours to turn about its axis. Jupiter is surrounded by dozens of moons, and its rings are faint and composedof dust. Deep in the planet's atmosphere, high pressure and temperature have compressed the hydrogen gas into a liquid, creating the largest ocean in the solar system, according to NASA.Earth's atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen. More solar energy is received by tropical regions than polar regions and is redistributed by atmospheric and ocean circulation. Greenhouse gases also play an important role in regulating the surface temperature. A region's climate is not only determined by latitude, but also by elevation and proximity to moderating oceans, among other factors. Severe weather, such as tropical cyclones, thunderstorms, and heatwaves, occurs in most areas and greatly impacts life</h2>
